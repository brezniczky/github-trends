Picking a Language for Server-Side Programming (Working Draft)
==============================================================

Introduction
------------

I don't have much to do with server-side programming these days, so I'll
let the charts speak for themselves, mostly.

The method was to search for keywords using a GitHub client script over
weekly intervals, starting from 2008-01-01, and then using a 26 week
radius Daniel k-filter to plot some comprehensibly smooth charts and
somewhat compensate for likely seasonality effects.

The [Wikipedia Diffusion of
innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)
article may give some ideas what curve types we see on the charts,
however it is hard to decide the impregnation of what area(s) are
described by each curve from merely these graphs, and to find out which
of these, if any, have already started to reach into the flattening out
(late majority) phase.

Conclusion
----------

No conclusion here - choose whatever best fits.

Note: PHP and JavaScript (or derivatives, like Node.JS) have probably
been unreasonably left out from the above comparisons and will be added
soon where relevant.
