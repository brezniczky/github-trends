# github-trends

Stuff for having a look at GitHub repository trends.

You can check out the main report rendered as a markdown document over here:
[Picking a Language for Analytics and Machine Learning](https://github.com/brezniczky/github-trends/blob/master/analysis.md)

This is a guide in a few charts and comments towards picking your first analytics language.
The conclusion is Python, however it is not a definitive answer and the reasoning isn't 100% either, yet appears correct.
This is not a guide to the "best language for analytics", although is close enough.

The foster child in its infancy is here:
[Picking a Language for Server-Side Programming ](https://github.com/brezniczky/github-trends/blob/master/analysis_server.md)

This one is only a series of charts. Would be interesting to find out what (which) microservices related event triggered PHP+JavaScript jump around mid 2015.
